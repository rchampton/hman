    * Must-haves

    * Update GUI
        6) let the loser know the word
        1) Result of choice delay anim
            * Add a Wrong! and Right! screen presented for 1 second after each guess
        2) anim for winner & loser
        3) Avatars, male & female
        5) "Enter" instead of symbol

    * Done
        5) Get a set of letters, like scrablle whatever, maybe even with points on them
            work those into the game instead of the keyboard

        * If player gets a letter right 
            1) It's still their turn
            2) Update other player to let them know their opponent is guessing again

        1) Ensure no spaces leading or trailing or within word
            (ui takes care of this (no space as input symbol))
        2) Instead of using INPUT for user name, use a div
        3) Backspace and Enter keys aren't implemented for login screen
        4) login change to "Enter Player Name"

    * Production version
        1) Remove all console.* calls
        2) Use minified libraries (lodash, machina)
        3) Github

    * Game config
        1) Word length
        2) Best out of
        3) Observe opponent's plays 
        4) Mirror mode, a la Wheel of Fortune
        5) Race mode, first to finish w/o busting wins
